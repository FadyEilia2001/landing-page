# Landing Page Project

This is my first landing page project, built as part of **The Odin Project** foundations course.

## Features
- Responsive layout with **Flexbox**
- Hero section with a call-to-action button
- Random information cards
- Quote/testimonial section
- Footer with a secondary call-to-action

## What I Learned
- Structuring HTML with semantic elements (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)
- Styling with CSS: box model, spacing, typography
- Using **Flexbox** for layout
- Pseudo-classes like `:hover` and `:active` to add interactivity
- Adding shadows, transitions, and simple animations for a more modern look

## Next Steps
- Clean up and organize CSS into reusable utility classes
- Add responsive design with media queries
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Eventually rebuild this with a component-based framework (React)
